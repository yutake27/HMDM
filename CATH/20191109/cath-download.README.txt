CATH Database Downloads
=======================

## What is CATH?

The CATH database is a free, publicly available online resource that provides 
information on the evolutionary relationships of protein domains. It was 
created in the mid-1990s by Professor Christine Orengo and colleagues, and 
continues to be developed by the Orengo group at University College London.

## How is CATH-Gene3D created?

Experimentally-determined protein three-dimensional structures are obtained from
the Protein Data Bank and split into their consecutive polypeptide chains, where
applicable. Protein domains are identified within these chains using a mixture
of automatic methods and manual curation. The domains are then classified within
the CATH structural hierarchy: at the Class \(C\) level, domains are assigned
according to their secondary structure content, i.e. all alpha, all beta, a
mixture of alpha and beta, or little secondary structure; at the Architecture
(A) level, information on the secondary structure arrangement in
three-dimensional space is used for assignment; at the Topology/fold (T) level,
information on how the secondary structure elements are connected and arranged
is used; assignments are made to the Homologous superfamily (H) level if there
is good evidence that the domains are related by evolution, i.e. they are
homologous.

Additional sequence data for domains with no experimentally determined
structures are provided by our sister resource, Gene3D, which are used to
populate the homologous superfamilies. Protein sequences from UniProtKB and
Ensembl are scanned against CATH HMMs to predict domain sequence boundaries and
make homologous superfamily assignments.

## CATH Releases

We aim to provide official releases of the CATH classification every 12 months.
This release process is important because is allows us to provide internal
validation, extra annotations and analysis. However, it can mean that there is a
time delay between new structures appearing in the PDB and the latest official 
CATH release,

In order to address this issue: CATH-B provides a limited amount of information
to the very latest domain annotations (e.g. domain boundaries and superfamily
classifications).

The latest release of CATH-Gene3D (v4.1) was released in July 2016 and 
consists of:

* 500,238    structural protein domain entries
* 151,013,797 non-structural protein domain entries
* 6,631       homologous superfamily entries
* 212,872      functional family entries

All CATH data can be downloaded via the FTP site:

    ftp://ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/pub/cath

or via the download section of the CATH website:

    http://www.cathdb.info/download
    
The root directory contains this ```README```, a second README detailing known 
differences in file content across the different versions 
(```README-known-version-differences.txt```), and two
immediate subdirectories: ```releases``` and ```supplementary-materials```.
Data within these directories are described below.

## Accessing data files through the REST API

The individual PDB files for domains, chains and whole proteins can be downloaded 
through the REST API.

### Accessing PDB files for a particular domain/chain/PDB id

To access these files for a particular domain/chain/PDB id, these files can 
be accessed via the following URLs:

```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/id/<domain_id>.pdb```
```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/id/<chain_id>.pdb```
```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/id/<pdb_id>.pdb```



### Accessing PDB files for all domains in CATH

To access the files for all domain ids in all superfamilies, first obtain the entire 
list of domain ids from the latest official version from the file:

```http://download.cathdb.info/cath/releases/all-releases/latest_release/cath-classification-data/cath-domain-list.txt```

Or, to access the files for all domains ids in a particular superfamily, use:

```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/cathtree/from_cath_id_to_depth/<superfamily_id>/<depth>```

e.g. list all domains (i.e. CATH hierarchy depth=9 ) in the superfamily 1.10.8.10

```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/cathtree/from_cath_id_to_depth/1.10.8.10/9```

For each domain id retrieved, access its PDB file via the following URL:

```http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_3_0/api/rest/id/<domain_id>.pdb```


## Directory Structure

### ```releases/```

This directory contains all of the CATH-Gene3D database releases, from the 
first to the latest. All previous releases are in 
```releases/previous-releases/``` and the latest release is in 
```releases/latest-release/```.

#### ```releases/daily-release/```

This directory provides summary information of protein domains putatively 
classified in CATH since the last release.

For each date with a CATH-B entry, there should be five files, e.g.:

cath-b-20170519-all.gz
:   combination of the 'latest release' and 'putative entries' files

cath-b-20170519-latest-release.gz
:   all domains that were in the latest release of CATH

cath-b-20170519-putative.gz
:   the domains assigned/rechopped/reassigned in CATH since the latest release

cath-b-20170519-names-all.gz
:   name description of each node in the CATH hierarchy. A combination of the 
'latest release' and 'putative entries' files

cath-b-20170519-s35-all.gz
:   all domain ids in CATH-B with their S35 cluster id and domain boundary 
information.

**Notes:**

* These are compressed files; once downloaded you should uncompress them with 
a suitable program (e.g. gunzip) before use.
* Please note that the 'latest release' and 'putative' files have no domains 
in common.
* The first three files use one line per domain and use the following format:

    domain_id status putative_superfamily_id putative_chopping

* The names file follows the file format described in 
```./README-cath-names-file-format.txt``` (a.k.a. CNF format).

##### ```releases/<release-type>/<version>/non-redundant-data-sets/```

The non-redundant data sets contain a non-redundant subset of CATH domains that:
* have no pair of domains (according to BLAST) with >= 20 or 40% sequence 
identity (depending on the data set chosen), over 60% overlap (over the longer 
sequence
* is as big as we could make it otherwise.

**Files**

cath-dataset-nonredundant-S[20|40]-v4_1_0.atom.fa
: The ATOM sequences of the domains in the dataset (which only contain residues 
that have ATOM records in the PDB file)

cath-dataset-nonredundant-S[20|40]-v4_3_0.fa
: The sequences of the domains in the dataset

cath-dataset-nonredundant-S[20|40]-v4_3_0.list
: A list of the domains in the dataset; one domain ID per line

cath-dataset-nonredundant-S[20|40]-v4_3_0.pdb.tgz
: (A gzipped tar file containing) the PDB files of the domains in the data set

**Method of Construction**

The sequence comparisons are performed with an all-against-all BLAST of our
domain sequences. We then use these results to identify any links with:
 * \>= 40% sequence identity                ( ie pident \>= 40 ) and
 * \>= 60% overlap over the longer sequence ( ie 100.0 * length / max(slen, 
qlen) \>= 60 )

We use this to form a list of domains that contains no pair of linked entries. 
In an effort to make the list as large as possible, we build the list by 
iteratively choosing each domain to add to the list, ensuring that a domain is 
only added if it has as few linked neighbours as any other domain. This means 
the algorithm should nibble as many edges off a cluster as possible, rather 
than taking a small number of domains at the cluster's centre.

##### ```releases/<release-type>/<version>/sequence-data/```

This directory contains protein domain sequence-based data.

cath-domain-seqs-*-<version>.fa
: Sequences for each CATH domain.

* e.g. cath-domain-seqs-S35-v4_3_0.fa

Hidden Markov model (HMMs) libraries are provided for the S35 rep sequence 
clusters and the functional families (FunFams). A HMM is generated for each S35 
sequence cluster and for each functional family using ```hmmbuild``` from the 
HMMER3 software package. All of the S35 sequence cluster HMMs and functional 
family HMMs are concatenated to create these two HMM library files:

* cath-S35-<version>-hmm3.lib.gz
* funfam-hmm3-<version>.lib.gz

These are compressed files; once downloaded you should uncompress them with a 
suitable program (e.g. gunzip) before use. The program ```hmmpress``` should 
then be run on each of these files to construct binary compressed data files.


###### ```./sequence-by-superfamily/```

cath-superfamily-seqs-<superfamily>-<version>.fa
: Sequences for each CATH superfamily in FASTA format. The files have this 
format:
